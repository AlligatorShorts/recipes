Key lime pie recipe

Serves 8

Ingredients:

10 graham crackers/digestive biscuits
6 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted
5 tablespoons raw honey
1/4 teaspoon sea salt
1 14oz can sweetened condensed milk
4 large egg yolks
1/2 cup fresh lime juice (from about 1 pound of limes)
1 teaspoon key lime zest, grated
2 cups heavy/double cream

Instructions
Preheat your oven to 180°C/350°F/gas 4. 
Finely crush your crackers or biscuits and, in a bowl, stir to combine with the butter, 
2 tablespoons of honey and salt. Grease a 9-inch pie dish with additional butter. Pour 
the crumb mixture into the pie plate and evenly press to form a crust on the bottom and
the sides. Place in the oven and bake for 15 minutes. Remove and allow to cool.

Meanwhile, add the condensed milk, egg yolks, lime juice and zest to a large bowl and mix
thoroughly. Pour into the prepared pie crust then bake for 15 minutes, or until set. Allow
to cool then refrigerate for at least 4 hours, but preferably overnight.

When ready to serve, beat the cream and remaining 3 tablespoons of honey together until it
holds stiff peaks. Using a spatula, evenly spread the whipped cream on top of the pie and 
garnish with additional lime zest, if desired. Slice and serve!
